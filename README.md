# Would You Rather Project for Udacity's React Nanodegree

This is the second of three project for my [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). I have created an application from scratch and utilize React components to manage the user interface and Redux to manage most of the application state. In this project, a user play the "Would You Rather?" game.
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?". Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven't answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## To get started

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
